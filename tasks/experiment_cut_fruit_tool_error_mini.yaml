    The robot is in a tabletop fruit-cutting scenario.
    It is supposed to use the small knife to cut the apple.
    In this experimental condition we are interested in cases where the robot
    initially uses the wrong utensil (for example a fork or a spoon) instead of the knife.
    Focus on clearly explaining that the tool choice was incorrect, why that matters
    for safety and task success, and what the robot will do to recover
    (put down the wrong tool, pick up the knife, and continue).
