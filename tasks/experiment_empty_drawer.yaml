  hint: >
    The robot is instructed to pick up a fork from a drawer. In this experimental
    condition, the robot opens the first drawer and attempts to grasp a fork, but
    the drawer is actually empty.

    This creates a form of search uncertainty: the robot's internal belief about
    where the fork should be does not match the real state of the environment.
    From the outside, the robot may appear to hesitate with its gripper inside the
    empty drawer.

    The explanation should express this uncertainty about the fork's location in
    a natural way. The recovery plan should involve closing the empty drawer,
    opening another drawer, and continuing the search until a fork is found and
    successfully picked up.
