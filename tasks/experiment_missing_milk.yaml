    The robot is asked to retrieve a milk carton. It first opens the refrigerator
    and attempts to detect and grasp the milk inside. However, in this
    experimental condition, the refrigerator is empty.

    At the same time, the milk carton is actually placed on the table next to the
    robot, but outside the robot's initial field of view. As a result, the robot
    mistakenly believes that the milk might still be inside the refrigerator.

    The explanation should describe this viewpoint-based perceptual limitation,
    making it clear that the robot could not see the milk at first. The recovery
    plan should involve changing the viewing angle, scanning the surrounding
    area, and then successfully detecting and picking up the milk carton from
    the table.
