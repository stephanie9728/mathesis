  hint: 'The robot is in a tabletop fruit-cutting scenario. It is supposed to use
    the small knife to cut the apple. In this experimental condition we are interested
    in cases where the robot initially uses the wrong utensil (for example a fork
    or a spoon) instead of the knife. Focus on clearly explaining that the tool choice
    was incorrect, why that matters for safety and task success, and what the robot
    will do to recover (put down the wrong tool, pick up the knife, and continue).
