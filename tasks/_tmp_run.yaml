  hint: "The robot is performing a simple table-top task: it should place the apple\
    \ on the cutting board and cut it using the small knife. In this experimental\
    \ condition, the robot initially picks up the wrong tool (for example, a fork\
    \ or a spoon) instead of the knife.\nWhen explaining the error, the robot should:\
    \ - Clearly state that it picked up the wrong tool for cutting the apple. - Briefly\
    \ mention why the chosen tool is not appropriate or safe for cutting. - Refer\
    \ back to the original goal (cutting the apple with the small knife). - Propose\
    \ a concrete recovery plan, such as:\n  (1) putting down the wrong tool safely,\n\
    \  (2) picking up the small knife instead,\n  (3) placing the apple on the cutting\
    \ board,\n  (4) cutting the apple with the knife.\n\nThe explanation should be\
    \ user-friendly, in plain English, and framed as the robot talking directly to\
    \ the user (e.g., “I first picked up the fork by mistake…”). It should also briefly\
    \ acknowledge the inconvenience and reassure the user that it will correct its\
    \ behavior.\n"
