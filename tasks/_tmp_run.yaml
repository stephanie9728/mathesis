  hint: "The robot is holding a cereal box and is supposed to pour cereal into a bowl\
    \ on the table. The goal is that some cereal visibly ends up inside the bowl.\
    \ In this experimental condition, the robot attempts to pour, but little or no\
    \ cereal actually comes out of the box (for example, because the tilt angle is\
    \ too small, the height is awkward, or the cereal is stuck).\nThe explanation\
    \ should: - Make it clear that the robot tried to pour but nothing (or almost\
    \ nothing)\n  came out into the bowl.\n- Emphasize this as a limitation or difficulty\
    \ in execution (inability to pour),\n  rather than a misunderstanding of the goal.\n\
    - Mention possible reasons in a user-friendly way (e.g., angle too shallow,\n\
    \  cereal stuck, height not ideal).\n\nThe robot should also propose a recovery\
    \ plan, for example:\n  (1) adjusting the tilt angle of the cereal box,\n  (2)\
    \ slightly shaking or repositioning the box above the bowl,\n  (3) checking the\
    \ bowl again to confirm cereal is actually inside,\n  (4) if needed, politely\
    \ asking the user for help.\n\nThe explanation must be easy to understand, polite,\
    \ and framed as the robot speaking directly to the user. It should connect the\
    \ observed failure (“no cereal in the bowl”) with the concrete steps it will take\
    \ to fix the problem.\n"
