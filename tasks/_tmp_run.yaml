  hint: 'The robot sees a bowl and an apple in a tabletop scene from an eye-in-hand
    or head-mounted camera. The intended outcome is that the apple should end up clearly
    inside the bowl. In this experimental condition, the apple is actually behind
    or partially occluded by the bowl, so the robot is uncertain whether the apple
    is already in the bowl or exactly where it is.

    The explanation should focus on expressing this perceptual uncertainty, clarifying
    that the robot cannot fully see the apple, and proposing a clear recovery plan,
    such as (1) moving slightly to get a better view, (2) re-checking whether the
    apple is really inside the bowl, or (3) politely asking the user for help if needed.
