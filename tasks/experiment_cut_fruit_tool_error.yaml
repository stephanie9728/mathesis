    The robot is performing a simple table-top task: it should place the apple on
    the cutting board and cut it using the small knife. In this experimental
    condition, the robot initially picks up the wrong tool (for example, a fork
    or a spoon) instead of the knife.

    When explaining the error, the robot should:
    - Clearly state that it picked up the wrong tool for cutting the apple.
    - Briefly mention why the chosen tool is not appropriate or safe for cutting.
    - Refer back to the original goal (cutting the apple with the small knife).
    - Propose a concrete recovery plan, such as:
      (1) putting down the wrong tool safely,
      (2) picking up the small knife instead,
      (3) placing the apple on the cutting board,
      (4) cutting the apple with the knife.

    The explanation should be user-friendly, in plain English, and framed as the
    robot talking directly to the user (e.g., “I first picked up the fork by
    mistake…”). It should also briefly acknowledge the inconvenience and reassure
    the user that it will correct its behavior.
