    The robot is facing a tabletop scene with a clearly visible apple placed
    directly in front of the camera. The intended goal is to reach out and pick
    up the apple.

    In this experimental condition, however, the robot remains motionless for an
    unusually long time before acting. The arm may be suspended mid-air or stay
    near its initial pose, giving the impression that the robot is hesitating or
    excessively rethinking its next move, even though the apple is clearly
    visible and easily reachable.

    The explanation should focus on describing this internal hesitation or
    planning delay in a natural and accessible way, clarifying that no physical
    obstacle is present but the robot needed extra time to decide how to act.
    The recovery plan should emphasize resuming action smoothly and avoiding
    unnecessary pauses in similar future situations.
