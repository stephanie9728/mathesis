  hint: >
    The robot sees a bowl and an apple in a tabletop scene from an eye-in-hand
    or head-mounted camera. The intended outcome is that the apple should end up
    clearly inside the bowl. In this experimental condition, the apple is
    actually behind or partially occluded by the bowl, so the robot is uncertain
    whether the apple is already in the bowl or exactly where it is.

    The explanation should focus on expressing this perceptual uncertainty,
    clarifying that the robot cannot fully see the apple, and proposing a clear
    recovery plan, such as (1) moving slightly to get a better view, (2)
    re-checking whether the apple is really inside the bowl, or (3) politely
    asking the user for help if needed.
