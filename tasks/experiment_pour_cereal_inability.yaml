    The robot is holding a cereal box and is supposed to pour cereal into a bowl
    on the table. The goal is that some cereal visibly ends up inside the bowl.
    In this experimental condition, the robot attempts to pour, but little or no
    cereal actually comes out of the box (for example, because the tilt angle is
    too small, the height is awkward, or the cereal is stuck).

    The explanation should:
    - Make it clear that the robot tried to pour but nothing (or almost nothing)
      came out into the bowl.
    - Emphasize this as a limitation or difficulty in execution (inability to pour),
      rather than a misunderstanding of the goal.
    - Mention possible reasons in a user-friendly way (e.g., angle too shallow,
      cereal stuck, height not ideal).

    The robot should also propose a recovery plan, for example:
      (1) adjusting the tilt angle of the cereal box,
      (2) slightly shaking or repositioning the box above the bowl,
      (3) checking the bowl again to confirm cereal is actually inside,
      (4) if needed, politely asking the user for help.

    The explanation must be easy to understand, polite, and framed as the robot
    speaking directly to the user. It should connect the observed failure (“no
    cereal in the bowl”) with the concrete steps it will take to fix the problem.
